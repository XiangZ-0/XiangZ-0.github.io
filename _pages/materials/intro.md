<!-- I am a master student working closely with [Prof. Lei Yu](https://dvs-whu.cn/) at Wuhan University. Prior to this, I received my B.E. degree from the [Electronic Information School](http://eis.whu.edu.cn/index.shtml) of Wuhan University in 2020. I am a lifelong learner with broad interests, including computer vision, neuromorphic computing, and signal processing, and I am particularly interested in utilizing multi-modal data for robust perception in real-world environments. -->


I am currently a PhD student at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) of ETH Zurich, supervised by [Prof. Fisher Yu](https://www.yf.io/). Previously, I received my M.E. and B.E. degrees respectively in 2023 and 2020 from the [Electronic Information School](http://eis.whu.edu.cn/index.shtml) of Wuhan University, where I work closely with [Prof. Lei Yu](https://dvs-whu.cn/) on event-based vision. I am a lifelong learner with broad interests, including computer vision, signal processing, and neuromorphic computing. I am particularly interested in achieving robust perception in complex environments for real-world applications.
