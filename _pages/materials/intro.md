<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a master student working closely with [Prof. Lei Yu](https://dvs-whu.cn/) at Wuhan University. Prior to this, I received my B.E. degree from the [Electronic Information School](http://eis.whu.edu.cn/index.shtml) of Wuhan University in 2020. I am a lifelong learner with broad interests, including computer vision, neuromorphic computing, and signal processing, and I am particularly interested in utilizing multi-modal data for robust perception in real-world environments. Currently, I am finding an opportunity for Ph.D. study.
